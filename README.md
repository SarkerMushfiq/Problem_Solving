# Problem Solving

Welcome to my **Problem Solving** repository! This repository contains solutions to various programming problems I have solved across different platforms such as **Codeforces** and **LeetCode**. The solutions are implemented in multiple programming languages including **Python**, **C++**, and **Java**. This repository serves as a collection of my problem-solving journey and helps in enhancing my algorithmic skills.

## Overview

This repository contains solutions for problems from various coding platforms, with implementations in **Python**, **C++**, and **Java**. The problems range from **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **mathematics**, to **dynamic programming** and **greedy algorithms**.

The primary goal of this repository is to improve problem-solving skills and to document solutions to problems that I have encountered.

## Languages Used

- **Python**: For solving problems that require quick prototyping and easier code readability.
- **C++**: For performance-sensitive problems, often on competitive programming platforms like **Codeforces**.
- **Java**: Used for solving problems that require more object-oriented approaches, often for system design problems or LeetCode challenges.

## Platforms

Here are the platforms where the problems are sourced from:

- **Codeforces**: Competitive programming contests, practice problems.
- **LeetCode**: Algorithm challenges, interview questions.
- **Others**: HackerRank, CodeChef, etc.

You can view my solutions to problems from these platforms by checking the folders for each language.

## How to Use
